[size=15pt][b][u]Primedice Android Application![/u][/b][/size]

[b]Small intro:[/b]
I am a student Software Engineer in the Netherlands.
I didn't like to gamble on the mobile website, so I decided to make an Androidd application.

Now it is time to publish the first test version of this application.
I already tested it, but now it is time for other users to test!

[b]Phones tested:[/b]
- OnePlus One (GeertBerkers)
- OnePlus Two (GeertBerkers

[b]Who wants to help me?[/b]
If you want to help me test this Primedice application, send me a PM with your Primedice username and which phone you got!
I will respond and send you a link with downloadable application.
We will stay in contact trough PM. I will make a google spreadsheat for reporting bugs.
